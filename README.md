Written by Tristan Perry

This repository contains the files employees.sql, QuickDBDemployees, as well as a Resouces folder containing all relative CSV files, within the directory 'EmployeeSQL'.

The file 'employees.sql' has schema written to construct tables from the 6 CSV files, in necessary order to handle the table relationships through primary and foreign keys. Additionally, after the table schema, a series of queries is written with commented instuction and methods to select desired data. 

The 'QuickDBDemployees.sql' file contains an ERD constucted using 
https://app.quickdatabasediagrams.com to visualize the relationships between the tables used.
